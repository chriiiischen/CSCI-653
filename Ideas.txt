Aerodynamics: Computational Fluid Dynamics
				Sovling PDE (Euler or Navier-Stokes) using parallel computing
				Grid design (mesh)
							Problems needs to be solved: 1. mesh design problems
														 2. performance problems (analysis is time comsuming)


Structures: Finite Element Analysis
							Problems needs to be solved: ???
